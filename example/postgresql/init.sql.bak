The token can be regenerated at every request so that if a request with an invalid token is encountered, it can be reliably discarded. The token is considered invalid if it arrived with a request other than the action it was supposed to be associated with. Although less reliable, the use of the optional HTTP Referrer header can also be used to determine whether an incoming request was actually one that the user is authorized for, in the current context. Additionally, the user can also be prompted to confirm an action every time an action concerning potentially sensitive data is invoked. This way, even if the attacker manages to get the user to click on a malicious link and request the desired action, the user has a chance to recover by denying confirmation. This solution is also implicitly tied to using a second factor of authentication before performing such actions.

The `BareMetalHost` (BMH) CRD allows the `userData`, `metaData`, and `networkData` for the provisioned host to be specified as links to Kubernetes Secrets. There are fields for both the `Name` and `Namespace` of the Secret, meaning that versions of the baremetal-operator prior to 0.8.0, 0.6.2, and 0.5.2 will read a `Secret` from any namespace. A user with access to create or edit a `BareMetalHost` can thus exfiltrate a `Secret` from another namespace by using it as e.g. the `userData` for provisioning some host (note that this need not be a real host, it could be a VM somewhere).

BMO will only read a key with the name `value` (or `userData`, `metaData`, or `networkData`), so that limits the exposure somewhat. `value` is probably a pretty common key though. Secrets used by _other_ `BareMetalHost`s in different namespaces are always vulnerable. It is probably relatively unusual for anyone other than cluster administrators to have RBAC access to create/edit a `BareMetalHost`. This vulnerability is only meaningful, if the cluster has users other than administrators and users\' privileges are limited to their respective namespaces.

The patch prevents BMO from accepting links to Secrets from other namespaces as BMH input. Any BMH configuration is only read from the same namespace only.

While this could be used to create empty files, existing files would not be truncated. An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced. Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict this attack\'s scope but the exact scope of protection hasn\'t been analysed. This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and Kubernetes. The issue is fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.

Some workarounds are available. Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual
user on the host (such as with rootless containers that don\'t use `/etc/sub[ug]id`), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to create inodes in world-writable directories. A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though neither the extent to which the standard existing policies block this attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack have been thoroughly tested.', '');

Impact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial of
service.

Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checking
server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when
comparing the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of an
X.509 certificate. This may result in an exception that terminates the
application program.

Note that basic certificate chain validation (signatures, dates, ...) is not
affected, the denial of service can occur only when the application also
specifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP address.

TLS servers rarely solicit client certificates, and even when they do, they
generally don\'t perform a name check against a reference identifier (expected
identity), but rather extract the presented identity after checking the
certificate chain.  So TLS servers are generally not affected and the severity
of the issue is Moderate.

binfmt_flat: Fix corruption when not offsetting data start

Commit 04d82a6d0881 ("binfmt_flat: allow not offsetting data start")
introduced a RISC-V specific variant of the FLAT format which does
not allocate any space for the (obsolete) array of shared library
pointers. However, it did not disable the code which initializes the
array, resulting in the corruption of sizeof(long) bytes before the DATA
segment, generally the end of the TEXT segment.

Introduce MAX_SHARED_LIBS_UPDATE which depends on the state of
CONFIG_BINFMT_FLAT_NO_DATA_START_OFFSET to guard the initialization of
the shared library pointer region so that it will only be initialized
if space is reserved for it.', '');

KEYS: trusted: dcp: fix leak of blob encryption key

Trusted keys unseal the key blob on load, but keep the sealed payload in
the blob field so that every subsequent read (export) will simply
convert this field to hex and send it to userspace.

With DCP-based trusted keys, we decrypt the blob encryption key (BEK)
in the Kernel due hardware limitations and then decrypt the blob payload.
BEK decryption is done in-place which means that the trusted key blob
field is modified and it consequently holds the BEK in plain text.
Every subsequent read of that key thus send the plain text BEK instead
of the encrypted BEK to userspace.

This issue only occurs when importing a trusted DCP-based key and
then exporting it again. This should rarely happen as the common use cases
are to either create a new trusted key and export it, or import a key
blob and then just use it without exporting it again.

Fix this by performing BEK decryption and encryption in a dedicated
buffer. Further always wipe the plain text BEK buffer to prevent leaking
the key via uninitialized memory.', '');

drm/amd/display: Disable DMCUB timeout for DCN35

[Why]
DMCUB can intermittently take longer than expected to process commands.

Old ASIC policy was to continue while logging a diagnostic error - which
works fine for ASIC without IPS, but with IPS this could lead to a race
condition where we attempt to access DCN state while it\'s inaccessible,
leading to a system hang when the NIU port is not disabled or register
accesses that timeout and the display configuration in an undefined
state.

[How]
We need to investigate why these accesses take longer than expected, but
for now we should disable the timeout on DCN35 to avoid this race
condition. Since the waits happen only at lower interrupt levels the
risk of taking too long at higher IRQ and causing a system watchdog
timeout are minimal.', 'Use safe libraries to access resources such as files.

idpf: fix memory leaks and crashes while performing a soft reset

The second tagged commit introduced a UAF, as it removed restoring
q_vector->vport pointers after reinitializating the structures.
This is due to that all queue allocation functions are performed here
with the new temporary vport structure and those functions rewrite
the backpointers to the vport. Then, this new struct is freed and
the pointers start leading to nowhere.

But generally speaking, the current logic is very fragile. It claims
to be more reliable when the system is low on memory, but in fact, it
consumes two times more memory as at the moment of running this
function, there are two vports allocated with their queues and vectors.
Moreover, it claims to prevent the driver from running into "bad state",
but in fact, any error during the rebuild leaves the old vport in the
partially allocated state.
Finally, if the interface is down when the function is called, it always
allocates a new queue set, but when the user decides to enable the
interface later on, vport_open() allocates them once again, IOW there\'s
a clear memory leak here.

Just don\'t allocate a new queue set when performing a reset, that solves
crashes and memory leaks. Readd the old queue number and reopen the
interface on rollback - that solves limbo states when the device is left
disabled and/or without HW queues enabled.', '');

net: mana: Fix RX buf alloc_size alignment and atomic op panic

The MANA driver\'s RX buffer alloc_size is passed into napi_build_skb() to
create SKB. skb_shinfo(skb) is located at the end of skb, and its alignment
is affected by the alloc_size passed into napi_build_skb(). The size needs
to be aligned properly for better performance and atomic operations.
Otherwise, on ARM64 CPU, for certain MTU settings like 4000, atomic
operations may panic on the skb_shinfo(skb)->dataref due to alignment fault.

To fix this bug, add proper alignment to the alloc_size calculation.

It can be reproduced with cammands:

mkdir test
cd test/
echo +cpuset > ../cgroup.subtree_control
echo root > cpuset.cpus.partition
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset.cpus.effective
0-3
echo 0-3 > cpuset.cpus // taking away all cpus from root

This issue is caused by the incorrect rebuilding of scheduling domains.
In this scenario, test/cpuset.cpus.partition should be an invalid root
and should not trigger the rebuilding of scheduling domains. When calling
update_parent_effective_cpumask with partcmd_update, if newmask is not
null, it should recheck newmask whether there are cpus is available
for parect/cs that has tasks.', '');

 | Kernel panic - not syncing: UBSAN: integer subtraction overflow: Fatal exception

This is due to shift_and_mask() using a signed immediate to construct
the mask and being called with a shift of 31 (WORK_OFFQ_POOL_SHIFT) so
that it ends up decrementing from INT_MIN.

Use an unsigned constant \'1U\' to generate the mask in shift_and_mask().', 'Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking. Carefully review the service''s implementation before making it available to user. For instance you can use manual or automated code review to uncover vulnerabilities such as integer overflow. Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution. Always do bound checking before consuming user input data.');

This happens because the UAPI provides only seven configuration
registers and we are reading the eighth position of this u32 array.

Therefore, fix the out-of-bounds read in `v3d_csd_job_run()` by
accessing only seven positions on the \'__u32 [7]\' array. The eighth
register exists indeed on V3D 7.1, but it isn\'t currently used. That
being so, let\'s guarantee that it remains unused and add a note that it
could be set in a future patch.', '');

KVM: s390: fix validity interception issue when gisa is switched off

We might run into a SIE validity if gisa has been disabled either via using
kernel parameter "kvm.use_gisa=0" or by setting the related sysfs
attribute to N (echo N >/sys/module/kvm/parameters/use_gisa).

The validity is caused by an invalid value in the SIE control block\'s
gisa designation. That happens because we pass the uninitialized gisa
origin to virt_to_phys() before writing it to the gisa designation.

To fix this we return 0 in kvm_s390_get_gisa_desc() if the origin is 0.
kvm_s390_get_gisa_desc() is used to determine which gisa designation to
set in the SIE control block. A value of 0 in the gisa designation disables
gisa usage.

The issue surfaces in the host kernel with the following kernel message as
soon a new kvm guest start is attemted.

serial: sc16is7xx: fix TX fifo corruption

Sometimes, when a packet is received on channel A at almost the same time
as a packet is about to be transmitted on channel B, we observe with a
logic analyzer that the received packet on channel A is transmitted on
channel B. In other words, the Tx buffer data on channel B is corrupted
with data from channel A.

The problem appeared since commit 4409df5866b7 ("serial: sc16is7xx: change
EFR lock to operate on each channels"), which changed the EFR locking to
operate on each channel instead of chip-wise.

This commit has introduced a regression, because the EFR lock is used not
only to protect the EFR registers access, but also, in a very obscure and
undocumented way, to protect access to the data buffer, which is shared by
the Tx and Rx handlers, but also by each channel of the IC.

Fix this regression first by switching to kfifo_out_linear_ptr() in
sc16is7xx_handle_tx() to eliminate the need for a shared Rx/Tx buffer.

Secondly, replace the chip-wise Rx buffer with a separate Rx buffer for
each channel.', 'Use safe libraries when creating temporary files. For instance the standard library function mkstemp can be used to safely create temporary files.

x86/mm: Fix pti_clone_pgtable() alignment assumption

Guenter reported dodgy crashes on an i386-nosmp build using GCC-11
that had the form of endless traps until entry stack exhaust and then
#DF from the stack guard.

It turned out that pti_clone_pgtable() had alignment assumptions on
the start address, notably it hard assumes start is PMD aligned. This
is true on x86_64, but very much not true on i386.

These assumptions can cause the end condition to malfunction, leading
to a \'short\' clone. Guess what happens when the user mapping has a
short copy of the entry text?

Use the correct increment form for addr to avoid alignment
assumptions.', '');

That commit increased max_segment_size to 64KB, with the justification
that the SCSI core was already using that size when PAGE_SIZE == 64KB,
and that there was existing logic to split over-sized requests.

However with a sufficiently large request, the splitting logic causes
each sg to be split into two commands in the DMA table, leading to
overflow of the DMA table, triggering the BUG_ON().

With default settings the bug doesn\'t trigger, because the request size
is limited by max_sectors_kb == 1280, however max_sectors_kb can be
increased, and apparently some distros do that by default using udev
rules.

Fix the bug for 4KB kernels by reverting to the old max_segment_size.

For 64KB kernels the sg_tablesize needs to be halved, to allow for the
possibility that each sg will be split into two.', '');

vfs: Don\'t evict inode under the inode lru traversing context

The inode reclaiming process(See function prune_icache_sb) collects all
reclaimable inodes and mark them with I_FREEING flag at first, at that
time, other processes will be stuck if they try getting these inodes
(See function find_inode_fast), then the reclaiming process destroy the
inodes by function dispose_list(). Some filesystems(eg. ext4 with
ea_inode feature, ubifs with xattr) may do inode lookup in the inode
evicting callback function, if the inode lookup is operated under the
inode lru traversing context, deadlock problems may happen.

Case 1: In function ext4_evict_inode(), the ea inode lookup could happen
        if ea_inode feature is enabled, the lookup process will be stuck
	under the evicting context like this:

 1. File A has inode i_reg and an ea inode i_ea
 2. getfattr(A, xattr_buf) // i_ea is added into lru // lru->i_ea
 3. Then, following three processes running like this:

Case 2: In deleted inode writing function ubifs_jnl_write_inode(), file
        deleting process holds BASEHD\'s wbuf->io_mutex while getting the
	xattr inode, which could race with inode reclaiming process(The
        reclaiming process could try locking BASEHD\'s wbuf->io_mutex in
	inode evicting function), then an ABBA deadlock problem would
	happen as following:

 1. File A has inode ia and a xattr(with inode ixa), regular file B has
    inode ib and a xattr.
 2. getfattr(A, xattr_buf) // ixa is added into lru // lru->ixa

tcp: prevent concurrent execution of tcp_sk_exit_batch

Its possible that two threads call tcp_sk_exit_batch() concurrently,
once from the cleanup_net workqueue, once from a task that failed to clone
a new netns.  In the latter case, error unwinding calls the exit handlers
in reverse order for the \'failed\' netns.

tcp_sk_exit_batch() calls tcp_twsk_purge().
Problem is that since commit b099ce2602d8 ("net: Batch inet_twsk_purge"),
this function picks up twsk in any dying netns, not just the one passed
in via exit_batch list.

This means that the error unwind of setup_net() can "steal" and destroy
timewait sockets belonging to the exiting netns.

This allows the netns exit worker to proceed to call

WARN_ON_ONCE(!refcount_dec_and_test(&net->ipv4.tcp_death_row.tw_refcount));

without the expected 1 -> 0 transition, which then splats.

At same time, error unwind path that is also running inet_twsk_purge()
will splat as well:

... because refcount_dec() of tw_refcount unexpectedly dropped to 0.

This doesn\'t seem like an actual bug (no tw sockets got lost and I don\'t
see a use-after-free) but as erroneous trigger of debug check.

Add a mutex to force strict ordering: the task that calls tcp_twsk_purge()
blocks other task from doing final _dec_and_test before mutex-owner has
removed all tw sockets of dying netns.', '');

  ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---

This happened because fscache_cookie_state_machine() was slow and was
still running while another process invoked fscache_unuse_cookie();
this led to a fscache_cookie_lru_do_one() call, setting the
FSCACHE_COOKIE_DO_LRU_DISCARD flag, which was picked up by
fscache_cookie_state_machine(), withdrawing the cookie via
cachefiles_withdraw_cookie(), clearing cookie->cache_priv.

At the same time, yet another process invoked
cachefiles_prepare_write(), which found a NULL pointer in this code
line:

  struct cachefiles_object *object = cachefiles_cres_object(cres);

The next line crashes, obviously:

  struct cachefiles_cache *cache = object->volume->cache;

During cachefiles_prepare_write(), the "n_accesses" counter is
non-zero (via fscache_begin_operation()).  The cookie must not be
withdrawn until it drops to zero.

The counter is checked by fscache_cookie_state_machine() before
switching to FSCACHE_COOKIE_STATE_RELINQUISHING and
FSCACHE_COOKIE_STATE_WITHDRAWING (in "case
FSCACHE_COOKIE_STATE_FAILED"), but not for
FSCACHE_COOKIE_STATE_LRU_DISCARDING ("case
FSCACHE_COOKIE_STATE_ACTIVE").

This patch adds the missing check.  With a non-zero access counter,
the function returns and the next fscache_end_cookie_access() call
will queue another fscache_cookie_state_machine() call to handle the
still-pending FSCACHE_COOKIE_DO_LRU_DISCARD.', '');

xhci: Fix Panther point NULL pointer deref at full-speed re-enumeration

re-enumerating full-speed devices after a failed address device command
can trigger a NULL pointer dereference.

Full-speed devices may need to reconfigure the endpoint 0 Max Packet Size
value during enumeration. Usb core calls usb_ep0_reinit() in this case,
which ends up calling xhci_configure_endpoint().

On Panther point xHC the xhci_configure_endpoint() function will
additionally check and reserve bandwidth in software. Other hosts do
this in hardware

If xHC address device command fails then a new xhci_virt_device structure
is allocated as part of re-enabling the slot, but the bandwidth table
pointers are not set up properly here.
This triggers the NULL pointer dereference the next time usb_ep0_reinit()
is called and xhci_configure_endpoint() tries to check and reserve
bandwidth

Put simply, if the client has control over the whole process of generating and encoding the value, then simply protecting its integrity doesn''t help. Make sure to protect client side authentication tokens for confidentiality (encryption) and integrity (signed hash) Make sure that all session tokens use a good source of randomness Perform validation on the server side to make sure that client side data tokens are consistent with what is expected.');

Each team can own their slice of the graph independently, empowering them to deliver autonomously and incrementally. Instances of @apollo/query-planner >=2.0.0 and <2.8.5 are impacted by a denial-of-service vulnerability. @apollo/gateway versions >=2.0.0 and < 2.8.5 and Apollo Router <1.52.1 are also impacted through their use of @apollo/query-panner. If @apollo/query-planner is asked to plan a sufficiently complex query, it may loop infinitely and never complete. This results in unbounded memory consumption and either a crash or out-of-memory (OOM) termination. This issue can be triggered if you have at least one non-@key field that can be resolved by multiple subgraphs. To identify these shared fields, the schema for each subgraph must be reviewed. The mechanism to identify shared fields varies based on the version of Federation your subgraphs are using. You can check if your subgraphs are using Federation 1 or Federation 2 by reviewing their schemas. Federation 2 subgraph schemas will contain a @link directive referencing the version of Federation being used while Federation 1 subgraphs will not. For example, in a Federation 2 subgraph, you will find a line like @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0"). If a similar @link directive is not present in your subgraph schema, it is using Federation 1. Note that a supergraph can contain a mix of Federation 1 and Federation 2 subgraphs. This issue results from the Apollo query planner attempting to use a Number exceeding Javascript’s Number.MAX_VALUE in some cases. In Javascript, Number.MAX_VALUE is (2^1024 - 2^971). When the query planner receives an inbound graphql request, it breaks the query into pieces and for each piece, generates a list of potential execution steps to solve the piece. These candidates represent the steps that the query planner will take to satisfy the pieces of the larger query. As part of normal operations, the query planner requires and calculates the number of possible query plans for the total query. That is, it needs the product of the number of query plan candidates for each piece of the query. Under normal circumstances, after generating all query plan candidates and calculating the number of all permutations, the query planner moves on to stack rank candidates and prune less-than-optimal options. In particularly complex queries, especially those where fields can be solved through multiple subgraphs, this can cause the number of all query plan permutations to balloon. In worst-case scenarios, this can end up being a number larger than Number.MAX_VALUE. In Javascript, if Number.MAX_VALUE is exceeded, Javascript represents the value as “infinity”. If the count of candidates is evaluated as infinity, the component of the query planner responsible for pruning less-than-optimal query plans does not actually prune candidates, causing the query planner to evaluate many orders of magnitude more query plan candidates than necessary. This issue has been addressed in @apollo/query-planner v2.8.5, @apollo/gateway v2.8.5, and Apollo Router v1.52.1. Users are advised to upgrade. This issue can be avoided by ensuring there are no fields resolvable from multiple subgraphs. If all subgraphs are using Federation 2, you can confirm that you are not impacted by ensuring that none of your subgraph schemas use the @shareable directive. If you are using Federation 1 subgraphs, you will need to validate that there are no fields resolvable by multiple subgraphs.', 'Carefully validate and sanitize all user-controllable data prior to passing it to the XML parser routine.

If you have an impacted configuration as defined above, please upgrade to at least Apollo Router 1.52.1. If you cannot upgrade, you can mitigate the denial-of-service opportunity impacting External Coprocessors by setting the coprocessor.router.request.body configuration option to false. Please note that changing this configuration option will change the information sent to any coprocessors you have configured and may impact functionality implemented by those coprocessors. If you have developed a Native Rust Plugin and cannot upgrade, you can update your plugin to either not accumulate the request body or enforce a maximum body size limit. You can also mitigate this issue by limiting HTTP body payload sizes prior to the Router (e.g., in a proxy or web application firewall appliance).', 'This attack may be mitigated completely by using a parser that is not using a vulnerable container.

mm: gup: stop abusing try_grab_folio

A kernel warning was reported when pinning folio in CMA memory when
launching SEV virtual machine.  The splat looks like:

Per the analysis done by yangge, when starting the SEV virtual machine, it
will call pin_user_pages_fast(..., FOLL_LONGTERM, ...) to pin the memory. 
But the page is in CMA area, so fast GUP will fail then fallback to the
slow path due to the longterm pinnalbe check in try_grab_folio().

The slow path will try to pin the pages then migrate them out of CMA area.
But the slow path also uses try_grab_folio() to pin the page, it will
also fail due to the same check then the above warning is triggered.

In addition, the try_grab_folio() is supposed to be used in fast path and
it elevates folio refcount by using add ref unless zero.  We are guaranteed
to have at least one stable reference in slow path, so the simple atomic add
could be used.  The performance difference should be trivial, but the
misuse may be confusing and misleading.

Redefined try_grab_folio() to try_grab_folio_fast(), and try_grab_page()
to try_grab_folio(), and use them in the proper paths.  This solves both
the abuse and the kernel warning.

The proper naming makes their usecase more clear and should prevent from
abusing in the future.

smack: tcp: ipv4, fix incorrect labeling

Currently, Smack mirrors the label of incoming tcp/ipv4 connections:
when a label \'foo\' connects to a label \'bar\' with tcp/ipv4,
\'foo\' always gets \'foo\' in returned ipv4 packets. So,
1) returned packets are incorrectly labeled (\'foo\' instead of \'bar\')
2) \'bar\' can write to \'foo\' without being authorized to write.

Here is a scenario how to see this:

* Take two machines, let\'s call them C and S,
   with active Smack in the default state
   (no settings, no rules, no labeled hosts, only builtin labels)

* At S, add Smack rule \'foo bar w\'
   (labels \'foo\' and \'bar\' are instantiated at S at this moment)

* At S, at label \'bar\', launch a program
   that listens for incoming tcp/ipv4 connections

* From C, at label \'foo\', connect to the listener at S.
   (label \'foo\' is instantiated at C at this moment)
   Connection succeedes and works.

* Send some data in both directions.
* Collect network traffic of this connection.

All packets in both directions are labeled with the CIPSO
of the label \'foo\'. Hence, label \'bar\' writes to \'foo\' without
being authorized, and even without ever being known at C.

If anybody cares: exactly the same happens with DCCP.

This behavior 1st manifested in release 2.6.29.4 (see Fixes below)
and it looks unintentional. At least, no explanation was provided.

Under certain concurrent event orderings, a `wasmtime::Engine`''s internal type registry was susceptible to double-unregistration bugs due to a race condition, leading to panics and potentially type registry corruption. That registry corruption could, following an additional and particular sequence of concurrent events, lead to violations of WebAssembly''s control-flow integrity (CFI) and type safety. Users that do not use `wasmtime::Engine` across multiple threads are not affected. Users that only create new modules across threads over time are additionally not affected. Reproducing this bug requires creating and dropping multiple type instances (such as `wasmtime::FuncType` or `wasmtime::ArrayType`) concurrently on multiple threads, where all types are associated with the same `wasmtime::Engine`. **Wasm guests cannot trigger this bug.** See the "References" section below for a list of Wasmtime types-related APIs that are affected. Wasmtime maintains an internal registry of types within a `wasmtime::Engine` and an engine is shareable across threads. Types can be created and referenced through creation of a `wasmtime::Module`, creation of `wasmtime::FuncType`, or a number of other APIs where the host creates a function (see "References" below). Each of these cases interacts with an engine to deduplicate type information and manage type indices that are used to implement type checks in WebAssembly''s `call_indirect` function, for example. This bug is a race condition in this management where the internal type registry could be corrupted to trigger an assert or contain invalid state. Wasmtime''s internal representation of a type has individual types (e.g. one-per-host-function) maintain a registration count of how many time it''s been used. Types additionally have state within an engine behind a read-write lock such as lookup/deduplication information. The race here is a time-of-check versus time-of-use (TOCTOU) bug where one thread atomically decrements a type entry''s registration count, observes zero registrations, and then acquires a lock in order to unregister that entry. However, between when this first thread observed the zero-registration count and when it acquires that lock, another thread could perform the following sequence of events: re-register another copy of the type, which deduplicates to that same entry, resurrecting it and incrementing its registration count; then drop the type and decrement its registration count; observe that the registration count is now zero; acquire the type registry lock; and finally unregister the type. Now, when the original thread finally acquires the lock and unregisters the entry, it is the second time this entry has been unregistered. This bug was originally introduced in Wasmtime 19''s development of the WebAssembly GC proposal. This bug affects users who are not using the GC proposal, however, and affects Wasmtime in its default configuration even when the GC proposal is disabled.

Wasmtime first enabled support for tail calls by default in Wasmtime 21.0.0, although that release contained a bug where it was only on-by-default for some configurations. In Wasmtime 22.0.0 tail calls were enabled by default for all configurations. The specific crash happens when an exported function in a WebAssembly module (or component) performs a `return_call` (or `return_call_indirect` or `return_call_ref`) to an imported host function which captures a stack trace (for example, the host function raises a trap). In this situation, the stack-walking code previously assumed there was always at least one WebAssembly frame on the stack but with tail calls that is no longer true. With the tail-call proposal it''s possible to have an entry trampoline appear as if it directly called the exit trampoline. This situation triggers an internal assert in the stack-walking code which raises a Rust `panic!()`. When Wasmtime is compiled with Rust versions 1.80 and prior this means that an `extern "C"` function in Rust is raising a `panic!()`. This is technically undefined behavior and typically manifests as a process abort when the unwinder fails to unwind Cranelift-generated frames. When Wasmtime is compiled with Rust versions 1.81 and later this panic becomes a deterministic process abort. Overall the impact of this issue is that this is a denial-of-service vector where a malicious WebAssembly module or component can cause the host to crash. There is no other impact at this time other than availability of a service as the result of the crash is always a crash and no more. This issue was discovered by routine fuzzing performed by the Wasmtime project via Google''s OSS-Fuzz infrastructure. We have no evidence that it has ever been exploited by an attacker in the wild. All versions of Wasmtime which have tail calls enabled by default have been patched: * 21.0.x - patched in 21.0.2 * 22.0.x - patched in 22.0.1 * 23.0.x - patched in 23.0.3  * 24.0.x - patched in 24.0.1 * 25.0.x - patched in 25.0.2. Wasmtime versions from 12.0.x (the first release with experimental tail call support) to 20.0.x (the last release with tail-calls off-by-default) have support for tail calls but the support is disabled by default. These versions are not affected in their default configurations, but users who explicitly enabled tail call support will need to either disable tail call support or upgrade to a patched version of Wasmtime. The main workaround for this issue is to disable tail support for tail calls in Wasmtime, for example with `Config::wasm_tail_call(false)`. Users are otherwise encouraged to upgrade to patched versions.', '');

mm/hugetlb: fix hugetlb vs. core-mm PT locking

We recently made GUP\'s common page table walking code to also walk hugetlb
VMAs without most hugetlb special-casing, preparing for the future of
having less hugetlb-specific page table walking code in the codebase. 
Turns out that we missed one page table locking detail: page table locking
for hugetlb folios that are not mapped using a single PMD/PUD.

Assume we have hugetlb folio that spans multiple PTEs (e.g., 64 KiB
hugetlb folios on arm64 with 4 KiB base page size).  GUP, as it walks the
page tables, will perform a pte_offset_map_lock() to grab the PTE table
lock.

However, hugetlb that concurrently modifies these page tables would
actually grab the mm->page_table_lock: with USE_SPLIT_PTE_PTLOCKS, the
locks would differ.  Something similar can happen right now with hugetlb
folios that span multiple PMDs when USE_SPLIT_PMD_PTLOCKS.

Let\'s make huge_pte_lockptr() effectively use the same PT locks as any
core-mm page table walker would.  Add ptep_lockptr() to obtain the PTE
page table lock using a pte pointer -- unfortunately we cannot convert
pte_lockptr() because virt_to_page() doesn\'t work with kmap\'ed page tables
we can have with CONFIG_HIGHPTE.

Handle CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS correctly by checking in reverse order, such
that when e.g., CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS==2 with
PGDIR_SIZE==P4D_SIZE==PUD_SIZE==PMD_SIZE will work as expected.  Document
why that works.

There is one ugly case: powerpc 8xx, whereby we have an 8 MiB hugetlb
folio being mapped using two PTE page tables.  While hugetlb wants to take
the PMD table lock, core-mm would grab the PTE table lock of one of both
PTE page tables.  In such corner cases, we have to make sure that both
locks match, which is (fortunately!) currently guaranteed for 8xx as it
does not support SMP and consequently doesn\'t use split PT locks.

Extent Space Efficient (ESE) or thin provisioned volumes need to be

the non existence of a proper track format.

The check for incorrect length is to imprecise since other error cases
leading to transport of insufficient data also have this flag set.
This might lead to data corruption in certain error cases for example
during a storage server warmstart.

Fix by removing the check for incorrect length and replacing by
explicitly checking for invalid track format in transport mode.

bpf: Fix a kernel verifier crash in stacksafe()

Daniel Hodges reported a kernel verifier crash when playing with sched-ext.
Further investigation shows that the crash is due to invalid memory access
in stacksafe(). More specifically, it is the following code:

    if (exact != NOT_EXACT &&
        old->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE] !=
        cur->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE])
            return false;

The \'i\' iterates old->allocated_stack.
If cur->allocated_stack < old->allocated_stack the out-of-bound
access will happen.

To fix the issue add \'i >= cur->allocated_stack\' check such that if
the condition is true, stacksafe() should fail. Otherwise,
cur->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE] memory access is legal.', '');

mm/vmalloc: fix page mapping if vm_area_alloc_pages() with high order fallback to order 0

The __vmap_pages_range_noflush() assumes its argument pages** contains
pages with the same page shift.  However, since commit e9c3cda4d86e ("mm,
vmalloc: fix high order __GFP_NOFAIL allocations"), if gfp_flags includes
__GFP_NOFAIL with high order in vm_area_alloc_pages() and page allocation
failed for high order, the pages** may contain two different page shifts
(high order and order-0).  This could lead __vmap_pages_range_noflush() to
perform incorrect mappings, potentially resulting in memory corruption.

Users might encounter this as follows (vmap_allow_huge = true, 2M is for
PMD_SIZE):

kvmalloc(2M, __GFP_NOFAIL|GFP_X)
    __vmalloc_node_range_noprof(vm_flags=VM_ALLOW_HUGE_VMAP)
        vm_area_alloc_pages(order=9) ---> order-9 allocation failed and fallback to order-0
            vmap_pages_range()
                vmap_pages_range_noflush()
                    __vmap_pages_range_noflush(page_shift = 21) ----> wrong mapping happens

We can remove the fallback code because if a high-order allocation fails,
__vmalloc_node_range_noprof() will retry with order-0.  Therefore, it is
unnecessary to fallback to order-0 here.  Therefore, fix this by removing
the fallback code.', '');

i2c: tegra: Do not mark ACPI devices as irq safe

On ACPI machines, the tegra i2c module encounters an issue due to a
mutex being called inside a spinlock. This leads to the following bug:

	BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.c:585

	Call trace:
	__might_sleep
	__mutex_lock_common
	mutex_lock_nested

The problem arises because during __pm_runtime_resume(), the spinlock
&dev->power.lock is acquired before rpm_resume() is called. Later,
rpm_resume() invokes acpi_subsys_runtime_resume(), which relies on
mutexes, triggering the error.

To address this issue, devices on ACPI are now marked as not IRQ-safe,
considering the dependency of acpi_subsys_runtime_resume() on mutexes.', 'Use safe libraries when creating temporary files. For instance the standard library function mkstemp can be used to safely create temporary files. For shell scripts, the system utility mktemp does the same thing.

fix bitmap corruption on close_range() with CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE

copy_fd_bitmaps(new, old, count) is expected to copy the first
count/BITS_PER_LONG bits from old->full_fds_bits[] and fill
the rest with zeroes.  What it does is copying enough words
(BITS_TO_LONGS(count/BITS_PER_LONG)), then memsets the rest.
That works fine, *if* all bits past the cutoff point are
clear.  Otherwise we are risking garbage from the last word
we\'d copied.

For most of the callers that is true - expand_fdtable() has
count equal to old->max_fds, so there\'s no open descriptors
past count, let alone fully occupied words in ->open_fds[],
which is what bits in ->full_fds_bits[] correspond to.

The other caller (dup_fd()) passes sane_fdtable_size(old_fdt, max_fds),
which is the smallest multiple of BITS_PER_LONG that covers all
opened descriptors below max_fds.  In the common case (copying on
fork()) max_fds is ~0U, so all opened descriptors will be below
it and we are fine, by the same reasons why the call in expand_fdtable()
is safe.

Unfortunately, there is a case where max_fds is less than that
and where we might, indeed, end up with junk in ->full_fds_bits[] -
close_range(from, to, CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE) with
	* descriptor table being currently shared
	* \'to\' being above the current capacity of descriptor table
	* \'from\' being just under some chunk of opened descriptors.
In that case we end up with observably wrong behaviour - e.g. spawn
a child with CLONE_FILES, get all descriptors in range 0..127 open,
then close_range(64, ~0U, CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE) and watch dup(0) ending
up with descriptor #128, despite #64 being observably not open.

The minimally invasive fix would be to deal with that in dup_fd().
If this proves to add measurable overhead, we can go that way, but
let\'s try to fix copy_fd_bitmaps() first.

* new helper: bitmap_copy_and_expand(to, from, bits_to_copy, size).
* make copy_fd_bitmaps() take the bitmap size in words, rather than
bits; it\'s \'count\' argument is always a multiple of BITS_PER_LONG,
so we are not losing any information, and that way we can use the
same helper for all three bitmaps - compiler will see that count
is a multiple of BITS_PER_LONG for the large ones, so it\'ll generate
plain memcpy()+memset().

[CAUSE]
Although I cannot reproduce the error, the report itself is good enough
to pin down the cause.

The call trace is the regular endio workqueue context, but the
free-by-task trace is showing that during btrfs_submit_chunk() we
already hit a critical error, and is calling btrfs_bio_end_io() to error
out.  And the original endio function called bio_put() to free the whole
bio.

This means a double freeing thus causing use-after-free, e.g.:

1. Enter btrfs_submit_bio() with a read bio
   The read bio length is 128K, crossing two 64K stripes.

2. The first run of btrfs_submit_chunk()

2.1 Call btrfs_map_block(), which returns 64K
2.2 Call btrfs_split_bio()
    Now there are two bios, one referring to the first 64K, the other
    referring to the second 64K.
2.3 The first half is submitted.

3. The second run of btrfs_submit_chunk()

3.1 Call btrfs_map_block(), which by somehow failed
    Now we call btrfs_bio_end_io() to handle the error

3.2 btrfs_bio_end_io() calls the original endio function
    Which is end_bbio_data_read(), and it calls bio_put() for the
    original bio.

    Now the original bio is freed.

4. The submitted first 64K bio finished
   Now we call into btrfs_check_read_bio() and tries to advance the bio
   iter.
   But since the original bio (thus its iter) is already freed, we
   trigger the above use-after free.

   And even if the memory is not poisoned/corrupted, we will later call
   the original endio function, causing a double freeing.

[FIX]
Instead of calling btrfs_bio_end_io(), call btrfs_orig_bbio_end_io(),
which has the extra check on split bios and do the pr

SnappyMail uses the `cleanHtml()` function to cleanup HTML and CSS in emails. Research discovered that the function has a few bugs which cause an mXSS exploit. Because the function allowed too many (invalid) HTML elements, it was possible (with incorrect markup) to trick the browser to "fix" the broken markup into valid markup. As a result a motivated attacker may be able to inject javascript. However, due to the default Content Security Policy the impact of the exploit is minimal. It could be possible to create an attack which leaks some data when loading images through the proxy.
This way it might be possible to use the proxy to attack the local system, like with `http://localhost:5000/leak`. Another attack could be to load a JavaScript attachment of the email. This is very tricky as the email must link to every possible UID as each email has a unique UID which has a value between 1 and 18446744073709551615 **v2.38.0** and up now remove unsupported HTML elements which mitigates the issue.

nilfs2: fix state management in error path of log writing function

After commit a694291a6211 ("nilfs2: separate wait function from
nilfs_segctor_write") was applied, the log writing function
nilfs_segctor_do_construct() was able to issue I/O requests continuously
even if user data blocks were split into multiple logs across segments,
but two potential flaws were introduced in its error handling.

First, if nilfs_segctor_begin_construction() fails while creating the
second or subsequent logs, the log writing function returns without
calling nilfs_segctor_abort_construction(), so the writeback flag set on
pages/folios will remain uncleared.  This causes page cache operations to
hang waiting for the writeback flag.  For example,
truncate_inode_pages_final(), which is called via nilfs_evict_inode() when
an inode is evicted from memory, will hang.

Second, the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag set on normal inodes remain uncleared. 
As a result, if the next log write involves checkpoint creation, that\'s
fine, but if a partial log write is performed that does not, inodes with
NILFS_I_COLLECTED set are erroneously removed from the "sc_dirty_files"
list, and their data and b-tree blocks may not be written to the device,
corrupting the block mapping.

Fix these issues by uniformly calling nilfs_segctor_abort_construction()
on failure of each step in the loop in nilfs_segctor_do_construct(),
having it clean up logs and segment usages according to progress, and
correcting the conditions for calling nilfs_redirty_inodes() to ensure
that the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag is cleared.', '');

A potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the `/wireui/button` endpoint, specifically through the `label` query parameter. Malicious actors could exploit this vulnerability by injecting JavaScript into the `label` parameter, leading to the execution of arbitrary code in the victim''s browser. The `/wireui/button` endpoint dynamically renders button labels based on user-provided input via the `label` query parameter. Due to insufficient sanitization or escaping of this input, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript. By crafting such a request, an attacker can inject arbitrary code that will be executed by the browser when the endpoint is accessed. If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the affected website. This could lead to: **Session Hijacking**: Stealing session cookies, tokens, or other sensitive information. **User Impersonation**: Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users. **Phishing**: Redirecting users to malicious websites. **Content Manipulation**: Altering the appearance or behavior of the affected page to mislead users or execute further attacks. The severity of this vulnerability depends on the context of where the affected component is used, but in all cases, it poses a significant risk to user security.

Affected versions of vite were discovered to contain a DOM Clobbering vulnerability when building scripts to `cjs`/`iife`/`umd` output format. The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an img tag with an unsanitized name attribute) are present. DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. We have identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Vite bundled scripts, particularly when the scripts dynamically import other scripts from the assets folder and the developer sets the build output format to `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd`. In such cases, Vite replaces relative paths starting with `__VITE_ASSET__` using the URL retrieved from `document.currentScript`. However, this implementation is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The `document.currentScript` lookup can be shadowed by an attacker via the browser''s named DOM tree element access mechanism. This manipulation allows an attacker to replace the intended script element with a malicious HTML element. When this happens, the src attribute of the attacker-controlled element is used as the URL for importing scripts, potentially leading to the dynamic loading of scripts from an attacker-controlled server. This vulnerability can result in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on websites that include Vite-bundled files (configured with an output format of `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd`) and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags without properly sanitizing the name or id attributes.

btrfs: fix qgroup reserve leaks in cow_file_range

In the buffered write path, the dirty page owns the qgroup reserve until
it creates an ordered_extent.

Therefore, any errors that occur before the ordered_extent is created
must free that reservation, or else the space is leaked. The fstest
generic/475 exercises various IO error paths, and is able to trigger
errors in cow_file_range where we fail to get to allocating the ordered
extent. Note that because we *do* clear delalloc, we are likely to
remove the inode from the delalloc list, so the inodes/pages to not have
invalidate/launder called on them in the commit abort path.

This results in failures at the unmount stage of the test that look like:

  BTRFS: error (device dm-8 state EA) in cleanup_transaction:2018: errno=-5 IO failure
  BTRFS: error (device dm-8 state EA) in btrfs_replace_file_extents:2416: errno=-5 IO failure

negative number such as -9223372036854775808 is provided by the user.
Fix it by reordering clamp_val() and DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST() operations.', '');
INSERT INTO public.vulnerability (cve, url, title, score, severity, description, solution) VALUES ('CVE-2024-46760', 'https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-46760', 'wifi: rtw88: usb: schedule rx work after everything is set up', 0, 'unknown', e'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtw88: usb: schedule rx work after everything is set up

Right now it\'s possible to hit NULL pointer dereference in
rtw_rx_fill_rx_status on hw object and/or its fields because
initialization routine can start getting USB replies before
rtw_dev is fully setup.

The stack trace looks like this:

rtw_rx_fill_rx_status
rtw8821c_query_rx_desc
rtw_usb_rx_handler
...
queue_work
rtw_usb_read_port_complete
...
usb_submit_urb
rtw_usb_rx_resubmit
rtw_usb_init_rx
rtw_usb_probe

So while we do the async stuff rtw_usb_probe continues and calls
rtw_register_hw, which does all kinds of initialization (e.g.
via ieee80211_register_hw) that rtw_rx_fill_rx_status relies on.

Fix this by moving the first usb_submit_urb after everything
is set up.

For me, this bug manifested as:
[    8.893177] rtw_8821cu 1-1:1.2: band wrong, packet dropped
[    8.910904] rtw_8821cu 1-1:1.2: hw->conf.chandef.chan NULL in rtw_rx_fill_rx_status

The hotplug driver for powerpc (pci/hotplug/pnv_php.c) causes a kernel
crash when we try to hot-unplug/disable the PCIe switch/bridge from
the PHB.

The crash occurs because although the MSI data structure has been
released during disable/hot-unplug path and it has been assigned
with NULL, still during unregistration the code was again trying to
explicitly disable the MSI which causes the NULL pointer dereference and
kernel crash.

The patch fixes the check during unregistration path to prevent invoking
pci_disable_msi/msix() since its data structure is already freed.', '');

Squashfs: sanity check symbolic link size

Syzkiller reports a "KMSAN: uninit-value in pick_link" bug.

This is caused by an uninitialised page, which is ultimately caused
by a corrupted symbolic link size read from disk.

The reason why the corrupted symlink size causes an uninitialised
page is due to the following sequence of events:

1. squashfs_read_inode() is called to read the symbolic
   link from disk.  This assigns the corrupted value
   3875536935 to inode->i_size.

2. Later squashfs_symlink_read_folio() is called, which assigns
   this corrupted value to the length variable, which being a
   signed int, overflows producing a negative number.

3. The following loop that fills in the page contents checks that
   the copied bytes is less than length, which being negative means
   the loop is skipped, producing an uninitialised page.

This patch adds a sanity check which checks that the symbolic
link size is not larger than expected.

The NULL pointer is sk->sk_user_data, and the offset 8 is of protocol
in struct fou.

When fou_release() is called due to netns dismantle or explicit tunnel
teardown, udp_tunnel_sock_release() sets NULL to sk->sk_user_data.
Then, the tunnel socket is destroyed after a single RCU grace period.

So, in-flight udp4_gro_receive() could find the socket and execute the
FOU GRO handler, where sk->sk_user_data could be NULL.

Let\'s use rcu_dereference_sk_user_data() in fou_from_sock() and add NULL
checks in FOU GRO handlers.

The previous way of handling this through returning -EBUSY is not viable,
particularly when destroying AF_XDP socket, because the kernel proceeds
with removal anyway.

There is plenty of code between those calls and there is no need to create
a large critical section that covers all of them, same as there is no need
to protect ice_vsi_rebuild() with rtnl_lock().

Add xdp_state_lock mutex to protect ice_vsi_rebuild() and ice_xdp().

Leaving unprotected sections in between would result in two states that
have to be considered:
1. when the VSI is closed, but not yet rebuild
2. when VSI is already rebuild, but not yet open

The latter case is actually already handled through !netif_running() case,
we just need to adjust flag checking a little. The former one is not as
trivial, because between ice_vsi_close() and ice_vsi_rebuild(), a lot of
hardware interaction happens, this can make adding/deleting rings exit
with an error. Luckily, VSI rebuild is pending and can apply new
configuration for us in a managed fashion.

Ethtool callbacks can be executed while reset is in progress and try to

NULL pointer dereference seen below.

Reproduction steps:
Once the driver is fully initialized, trigger reset:
	# echo 1 > /sys/class/net/<interface>/device/reset
when reset is in progress try to get coalesce settings using ethtool:
	# ethtool -c <interface>

powerpc/qspinlock: Fix deadlock in MCS queue

If an interrupt occurs in queued_spin_lock_slowpath() after we increment
qnodesp->count and before node->lock is initialized, another CPU might
see stale lock values in get_tail_qnode(). If the stale lock value happens
to match the lock on that CPU, then we write to the "next" pointer of
the wrong qnode. This causes a deadlock as the former CPU, once it becomes
the head of the MCS queue, will spin indefinitely until it\'s "next" pointer
is set by its successor in the queue.

btrfs: fix race between direct IO write and fsync when using same fd

If we have 2 threads that are using the same file descriptor and one of
them is doing direct IO writes while the other is doing fsync, we have a
race where we can end up either:

1) Attempt a fsync without holding the inode\'s lock, triggering an
   assertion failures when assertions are enabled;

2) Do an invalid memory access from the fsync task because the file private
   points to memory allocated on stack by the direct IO task and it may be
   used by the fsync task after the stack was destroyed.

The race happens like this:

1) A user space program opens a file descriptor with O_DIRECT;

2) The program spawns 2 threads using libpthread for example;

3) One of the threads uses the file descriptor to do direct IO writes,
   while the other calls fsync using the same file descriptor.

4) Call task A the thread doing direct IO writes and task B the thread
   doing fsyncs;

5) Task A does a direct IO write, and at btrfs_direct_write() sets the
   file\'s private to an on stack allocated private with the member
   \'fsync_skip_inode_lock\' set to true;

6) Task B enters btrfs_sync_file() and sees that there\'s a private
   structure associated to the file which has \'fsync_skip_inode_lock\' set
   to true, so it skips locking the inode\'s VFS lock;

7) Task A completes the direct IO write, and resets the file\'s private to
   NULL since it had no prior private and our private was stack allocated.
   Then it unlocks the inode\'s VFS lock;

8) Task B enters btrfs_get_ordered_extents_for_logging(), then the
   assertion that checks the inode\'s VFS lock is held fails, since task B
   never locked it and task A has already unlocked it.

The stack trace produced is the following:

   assertion failed: inode_is_locked(&inode->vfs_inode), in fs/btrfs/ordered-data.c:983

ice: move netif_queue_set_napi to rtnl-protected sections

Currently, netif_queue_set_napi() is called from ice_vsi_rebuild() that is
not rtnl-locked when called from the reset. This creates the need to take
the rtnl_lock just for a single function and complicates the
synchronization with .ndo_bpf. At the same time, there no actual need to
fill napi-to-queue information at this exact point.

Fill napi-to-queue information when opening the VSI and clear it when the
VSI is being closed. Those routines are already rtnl-locked.

Also, rewrite napi-to-queue assignment in a way that prevents inclusion of
XDP queues, as this leads to out-of-bounds writes, such as one below.

can: bcm: Remove proc entry when dev is unregistered.

syzkaller reported a warning in bcm_connect() below. [0]

The repro calls connect() to vxcan1, removes vxcan1, and calls
connect() with ifindex == 0.

Calling connect() for a BCM socket allocates a proc entry.
Then, bcm_sk(sk)->bound is set to 1 to prevent further connect().

However, removing the bound device resets bcm_sk(sk)->bound to 0
in bcm_notify().

The 2nd connect() tries to allocate a proc entry with the same
name and sets NULL to bcm_sk(sk)->bcm_proc_read, leaking the
original proc entry.

Since the proc entry is available only for connect()ed sockets,
let\'s clean up the entry when the bound netdev is unregistered.

userfaultfd: fix checks for huge PMDs

Patch series "userfaultfd: fix races around pmd_trans_huge() check", v2.

The pmd_trans_huge() code in mfill_atomic() is wrong in three different
ways depending on kernel version:

1. The pmd_trans_huge() check is racy and can lead to a BUG_ON() (if you hit
   the right two race windows) - I\'ve tested this in a kernel build with
   some extra mdelay() calls. See the commit message for a description
   of the race scenario.
   On older kernels (before 6.5), I think the same bug can even
   theoretically lead to accessing transhuge page contents as a page table
   if you hit the right 5 narrow race windows (I haven\'t tested this case).
2. As pointed out by Qi Zheng, pmd_trans_huge() is not sufficient for
   detecting PMDs that don\'t point to page tables.
   On older kernels (before 6.5), you\'d just have to win a single fairly
   wide race to hit this.
   I\'ve tested this on 6.1 stable by racing migration (with a mdelay()
   patched into try_to_migrate()) against UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE - on my x86
   VM, that causes a kernel oops in ptlock_ptr().
3. On newer kernels (>=6.5), for shmem mappings, khugepaged is allowed
   to yank page tables out from under us (though I haven\'t tested that),
   so I think the BUG_ON() checks in mfill_atomic() are just wrong.

I decided to write two separate fixes for these (one fix for bugs 1+2, one
fix for bug 3), so that the first fix can be backported to kernels
affected by bugs 1+2.


This patch (of 2):

This fixes two issues.

I discovered that the following race can occur:

  mfill_atomic                other thread
  ============                ============
                              <zap PMD>
  pmdp_get_lockless() [reads none pmd]
  <bail if trans_huge>
  <if none:>
                              <pagefault creates transhuge zeropage>
    __pte_alloc [no-op]
                              <zap PMD>
  <bail if pmd_trans_huge(*dst_pmd)>
  BUG_ON(pmd_none(*dst_pmd))

I have experimentally verified this in a kernel with extra mdelay() calls;
the BUG_ON(pmd_none(*dst_pmd)) triggers.

On kernels newer than commit 0d940a9b270b ("mm/pgtable: allow
pte_offset_map[_lock]() to fail"), this can\'t lead to anything worse than
a BUG_ON(), since the page table access helpers are actually designed to
deal with page tables concurrently disappearing; but on older kernels
(<=6.4), I think we could probably theoretically race past the two
BUG_ON() checks and end up treating a hugepage as a page table.

The second issue is that, as Qi Zheng pointed out, there are other types
of huge PMDs that pmd_trans_huge() can\'t catch: devmap PMDs and swap PMDs
(in particular, migration PMDs).

On <=6.4, this is worse than the first issue: If mfill_atomic() runs on a
PMD that contains a migration entry (which just requires winning a single,
fairly wide race), it will pass the PMD to pte_offset_map_lock(), which
assumes that the PMD points to a page table.

Breakage follows: First, the kernel tries to take the PTE lock (which will
crash or maybe worse if there is no "struct page" for the address bits in
the migration entry PMD - I think at least on X86 there usually is no
corresponding "struct page" thanks to the PTE inversion mitigation, amd64
looks different).

If that didn\'t crash, the kernel would next try to write a PTE into what
it wrongly thinks is a page table.

As part of fixing these issues, get rid of the check for pmd_trans_huge()
before __pte_alloc() - that\'s redundant, we\'re going to have to check for
that after the __pte_alloc() anyway.

Backport note: pmdp_get_lockless() is pmd_read_atomic() in older kernels.', '');

When removing a resource from vmci_resource_table in

handle by comparing context and resource fields.

It is possible though to create two resources with different types
but same handle (same context and resource fields).

When trying to remove one of the resources, vmci_resource_remove()
may not remove the intended one, but the object will still be freed
as in the case of the datagram type in vmci_datagram_destroy_handle().
vmci_resource_table will still hold a pointer to this freed resource
leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.

binder: fix UAF caused by offsets overwrite

Binder objects are processed and copied individually into the target
buffer during transactions. Any raw data in-between these objects is
copied as well. However, this raw data copy lacks an out-of-bounds
check. If the raw data exceeds the data section size then the copy
overwrites the offsets section. This eventually triggers an error that
attempts to unwind the processed objects. However, at this point the
offsets used to index these objects are now corrupted.

Unwinding with corrupted offsets can result in decrements of arbitrary
nodes and lead to their premature release. Other users of such nodes are
left with a dangling pointer triggering a use-after-free. This issue is
made evident by the following KASAN report (trimmed):

It should be done in the reverse way, with a synchronize_rcu().

This is a good match for a pre_exit() method.

tcp_bpf: fix return value of tcp_bpf_sendmsg()

When we cork messages in psock->cork, the last message triggers the
flushing will result in sending a sk_msg larger than the current
message size. In this case, in tcp_bpf_send_verdict(), \'copied\' becomes
negative at least in the following case:

468         case __SK_DROP:
469         default:
470                 sk_msg_free_partial(sk, msg, tosend);

472                 *copied -= (tosend + delta); // <==== HERE
473                 return -EACCES;

Therefore, it could lead to the following BUG with a proper value of
\'copied\' (thanks to syzbot). We should not use negative \'copied\' as a
return value here.

mm/slub: add check for s->flags in the alloc_tagging_slab_free_hook

When enable CONFIG_MEMCG & CONFIG_KFENCE & CONFIG_KMEMLEAK, the following
warning always occurs,This is because the following call stack occurred:
mem_pool_alloc
    kmem_cache_alloc_noprof
        slab_alloc_node
            kfence_alloc

Once the kfence allocation is successful,slab->obj_exts will not be empty,
because it has already been assigned a value in kfence_init_pool.

Since in the prepare_slab_obj_exts_hook function,we perform a check for
s->flags & (SLAB_NO_OBJ_EXT | SLAB_NOLEAKTRACE),the alloc_tag_add function
will not be called as a result.Therefore,ref->ct remains NULL.

However,when we call mem_pool_free,since obj_ext is not empty, it
eventually leads to the alloc_tag_sub scenario being invoked.  This is
where the warning occurs.

So we should add corresponding checks in the alloc_tagging_slab_free_hook.
For __GFP_NO_OBJ_EXT case,I didn\'t see the specific case where it\'s using
kfence,so I won\'t add the corresponding check in
alloc_tagging_slab_free_hook for now.

can: mcp251x: fix deadlock if an interrupt occurs during mcp251x_open

The mcp251x_hw_wake() function is called with the mpc_lock mutex held and
disables the interrupt handler so that no interrupts can be processed while
waking the device. If an interrupt has already occurred then waiting for
the interrupt handler to complete will deadlock because it will be trying
to acquire the same mutex.

ASoC: Intel: Boards: Fix NULL pointer deref in BYT/CHT boards harder

Since commit 13f58267cda3 ("ASoC: soc.h: don\'t create dummy Component
via COMP_DUMMY()") dummy codecs declared like this:

SND_SOC_DAILINK_DEF(dummy,
        DAILINK_COMP_ARRAY(COMP_DUMMY()));

expand to:

static struct snd_soc_dai_link_component dummy[] = {
};

Which means that dummy is a zero sized array and thus dais[i].codecs should
not be dereferenced *at all* since it points to the address of the next
variable stored in the data section as the "dummy" variable has an address
but no size, so even dereferencing dais[0] is already an out of bounds
array reference.

Which means that the if (dais[i].codecs->name) check added in
commit 7d99a70b6595 ("ASoC: Intel: Boards: Fix NULL pointer deref
in BYT/CHT boards") relies on that the part of the next variable which
the name member maps to just happens to be NULL.

Which apparently so far it usually is, except when it isn\'t
and then it results in crashes like this one:

The token is considered invalid if it arrived with a request other than the action it was supposed to be associated with. Although less reliable, the use of the optional HTTP Referrer header can also be used to determine whether an incoming request was actually one that the user is authorized for, in the current context. Additionally, the user can also be prompted to confirm an action every time an action concerning potentially sensitive data is invoked. This way, even if the attacker manages to get the user to click on a malicious link and request the desired action, the user has a chance to recover by denying confirmation. This solution is also implicitly tied to using a second factor of authentication before performing such actions. In general, every request must be checked for the appropriate authentication token as well as authorization in the current session context.');

if there is another host connected with enabled paths we hang in tearing
them down. This is due to fact that the Thunderbolt networking driver
also tries to cleanup the paths and ends up blocking in

However, at this point we already cleaned the paths in tb_stop() so
there is really no need for tb_disconnect_xdomain_paths() to do that

bails out early so take advantage of that and mark the XDomain as

usb: dwc3: core: Prevent USB core invalid event buffer address access

This commit addresses an issue where the USB core could access an
invalid event buffer address during runtime suspend, potentially causing
SMMU faults and other memory issues in Exynos platforms. The problem
arises from the following sequence.
        1. In dwc3_gadget_suspend, there is a chance of a timeout when
        moving the USB core to the halt state after clearing the
        run/stop bit by software.
        2. In dwc3_core_exit, the event buffer is cleared regardless of
        the USB core\'s status, which may lead to an SMMU faults and
        other memory issues. if the USB core tries to access the event
        buffer address.

To prevent this hardware quirk on Exynos platforms, this commit ensures
that the event buffer address is not cleared by software  when the USB
core is active during runtime suspend by checking its status before
clearing the buffer address.', '');

soc: qcom: cmd-db: Map shared memory as WC, not WB

Linux does not write into cmd-db region. This region of memory is write
protected by XPU. XPU may sometime falsely detect clean cache eviction
as "write" into the write protected region leading to secure interrupt
which causes an endless loop somewhere in Trust Zone.

The only reason it is working right now is because Qualcomm Hypervisor
maps the same region as Non-Cacheable memory in Stage 2 translation
tables. The issue manifests if we want to use another hypervisor (like
Xen or KVM), which does not know anything about those specific mappings.

Changing the mapping of cmd-db memory from MEMREMAP_WB to MEMREMAP_WT/WC
removes dependency on correct mappings in Stage 2 tables. This patch
fixes the issue by updating the mapping to MEMREMAP_WC.

One longstanding feature of Plate is the ability to add custom DOM attributes to any element or leaf using the `attributes` property. These attributes are passed to the node component using the `nodeProps` prop. It has come to our attention that this feature can be used for malicious purposes, including cross-site scripting (XSS) and information exposure (specifically, users'' IP addresses and whether or not they have opened a malicious document). Note that the risk of information exposure via attributes is only relevant to applications in which web requests to arbitrary URLs are not ordinarily allowed. Plate editors that allow users to embed images from arbitrary URLs, for example, already carry the risk of leaking users'' IP addresses to third parties. All Plate editors using an affected version of @udecode/plate-core are vulnerable to these information exposure attacks via the style attribute and other attributes that can cause web requests to be sent. In addition, whether or not a Plate editor is vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks using attributes depends on a number of factors. The most likely DOM attributes to be vulnerable are href and src on links and iframes respectively. Any component that spreads {...nodeProps} onto an <a> or <iframe> element and does not later override href or src will be vulnerable to XSS. In patched versions of Plate, we have disabled element.attributes and leaf.attributes for most attribute names by default, with some exceptions including target, alt, width, height, colspan and rowspan on the link, image, video, table cell and table header cell plugins. If this is a breaking change for you, you can selectively re-enable attributes for certain plugins as follows. Please carefully research and assess the security implications of any attribute you allow, as even seemingly innocuous attributes such as style can be used maliciously. If you are unable to upgrade to any of the patched versions, you should use a tool like patch-package or yarn patch to remove the logic from @udecode/plate-core that adds attributes to nodeProps.', 'Use browser technologies that do not allow client-side scripting.

As bond_ipsec_add_sa_all and bond_ipsec_del_sa_all are only called
from bond_change_active_slave, which requires holding the RTNL lock.
And bond_ipsec_add_sa and bond_ipsec_del_sa are xfrm state
xdo_dev_state_add and xdo_dev_state_delete APIs, which are in user
context. So ipsec_lock doesn\'t have to be spin lock, change it to
mutex, and thus the above issue can be resolved.', 'Use safe libraries when creating temporary files. For instance the standard library function mkstemp can be used to safely create temporary files. For shell scripts, the system utility mktemp does the same thing. Access to the directories should be restricted as to prevent attackers from manipulating the files.

Bluetooth: btnxpuart: Fix random crash seen while removing driver

This fixes the random kernel crash seen while removing the driver, when
running the load/unload test over multiple iterations.

1) modprobe btnxpuart
2) hciconfig hci0 reset
3) hciconfig (check hci0 interface up with valid BD address)
4) modprobe -r btnxpuart
Repeat steps 1 to 4

The ps_wakeup() call in btnxpuart_close() schedules the psdata->work(),
which gets scheduled after module is removed, causing a kernel crash.

This hidden issue got highlighted after enabling Power Save by default
in 4183a7be7700 (Bluetooth: btnxpuart: Enable Power Save feature on
startup)

The new ps_cleanup() deasserts UART break immediately while closing
serdev device, cancels any scheduled ps_work and destroys the ps_lock
mutex.

In case of im_protocols value is 1 and tm_protocols value is 0 this

But then after pn533_poll_create_mod_list() call in pn533_start_poll()
poll mod list will remain empty and dev->poll_mod_count will remain 0
which lead to division by zero.

Normally no im protocol has value 1 in the mask, so this combination is
not expected by driver. But these protocol values actually come from
userspace via Netlink interface (NFC_CMD_START_POLL operation). So a
broken or malicious program may pass a message containing a "bad"
combination of protocol parameter values so that dev->poll_mod_count
is not incremented inside pn533_poll_create_mod_list(), thus leading
to division by zero.

Errata #i2037 in AM65x/DRA80xM Processors Silicon Revision 1.0
(SPRZ452D_July 2018_Revised December 2019 [1]) mentions when an
inbound PCIe TLP spans more than two internal AXI 128-byte bursts,
the bus may corrupt the packet payload and the corrupt data may
cause associated applications or the processor to hang.

The workaround for Errata #i2037 is to limit the maximum read
request size and maximum payload size to 128 bytes. Add workaround
for Errata #i2037 here.

The errata and workaround is applicable only to AM65x SR 1.0 and
later versions of the silicon will have this fixed.

The scenario is

  1. Thread A builds a skb with MSG_MORE and sets kcm->seq_skb.

  2. Thread A resumes building skb from kcm->seq_skb but is blocked
     by sk_stream_wait_memory()

  3. Thread B calls sendmsg() concurrently, finishes building kcm->seq_skb
     and puts the skb to the write queue

  4. Thread A faces an error and finally frees skb that is already in the
     write queue

  5. kcm_release() does double-free the skb in the write queue

When a thread is building a MSG_MORE skb, another thread must not touch it.

Let\'s add a per-sk mutex and serialise kcm_sendmsg().
